Welcome, in this folder you will find some project developed either by me or also with other team mates. The aim is to give an idea of the knowledge developed during the academic course and its application in the field of Data Science, in particular in the field of Text Analysis and Speech Processing. For possible HR, it might be interesting to analyse my modus operandi and the maturing process that took place during my master's degree. 
Some of these projects were examined and evaluated in the exam, others were developed following homework assignments during the courses. Where possible, there will also be a link to the realised power point for oral presentation. Last but not least, I hope that this material may also be useful to my friends and colleagues at the University of Naples and perhaps at other universities as well.
N.B There will be all the references that you need in the relative notebook which has been mainly developed on Colab.
